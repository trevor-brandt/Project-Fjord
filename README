Project Fjord:

This repo will host the code and wiki for team Fjord's capstone project for the spring 2012 term at PSU.

While it's extremely likely that this will be an open-source project, it is also for a class, so we will not accept pull requests from outside of Fjord inc. until August.

TODO:
-Decide on a project
-Speak to sponsors so as to do that
-Do what we want to do with the wiki
